Here's a summary based on our interactions:You are a tech enthusiast and a dedicated learner,
with a strong focus on improving your programming skills, particularly in C++. You often work
on diverse projects, such as calculators, matrix navigation problems, educational systems, games like Snake, and
library management systems. You prefer detailed explanations and precise corrections in your code to enhance
your understanding.You are methodical in your approach and have shown interest in areas like templates,
references, recursion, binary data manipulation, bitwise flags, and file handling in C++. You avoid relying
on shortcuts like built-in functions or the Standard Template Library (STL), preferring to build solutions
from the ground up. You also enjoy refining your designs, such as separating concerns in
constructors and improving code architecture.In addition to coding, you seem to be exploring hardware options,
frequently asking about laptops and GPUs for gaming or productivity. You have specific preferences for
devices with numeric keypads and are mindful of features like battery life and GPU performance.Your
learning extends beyond programming: you're practicing English with a friend, seeking topic suggestions, and incorporating
idioms and phrases into your conversations. This reflects your proactive and curious personality.Overall, you demonstrate
a strong work ethic, an eagerness to solve problems efficiently, and a commitment to learning
and improving in multiple areas.ure all necessary files are included. Common files you'll need:.sln file
(solution file)..vcxproj or .csproj (project file).Source code files (e.g., .cpp, .h, .cs).Any other essential files
(e.g., configuration files, resources).Optional: Exclude unnecessary files like bin, obj, or .vs folders. These can
be regenerated when someone builds the project.Compress the Project Folder:Right-click the project folder.Select Send to
> Compressed (zipped) folder.This creates a .zip file containing your entire project.Log in to GitHub:Go
to GitHub and log in.Create a New Repository:Click the + icon in the top-right corner
and select New repository.Fill in the repository name, description, and visibility settings.Click Create repository.Upload the
Project Folder:Once the repository is created, you'll see an option to Drag and drop files
or choose your files.Upload your .zip file.Add a Description (Optional):You can add a README file
or description to explain your project.Complete the Upload:Click Commit changes or Upload files to save
the upload.Share the Repository:Once the files are uploaded, share the repository URL with others.Limitations of
This Approach:Without Git, you lose version control and collaboration features.Any updates require manually replacing the
files or re-uploading the project.For full version control and collaboration, consider installing Git at a
later time and learning its basics.
